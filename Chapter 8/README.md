# Introduction

The derivatives we have solved so far have been with respect to a single variable. However, in the context of neural networks, we will often have to deal with multiple variables. This is where the concept of partial derivatives comes in.

To learn the impact of all inputs, weights, biases, and neuron output we need to calculate the derivative f each operation performed during forward pass. To do this we will use the chain rule.
